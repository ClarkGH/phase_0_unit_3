### Reflection
What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
There is no images folder so I didn't bother. The first time I took the first quiz I got 7/7, but I just clicked on things from memory the second time and only got 6/8. I'm not going to bother taking it again, I know what I'm doing.

SQL is very easy to work with. I just need practice and I'll be proficient at it.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Google is your best friend here.

SQL, hurray!

Very, I enjoyed it.

I love learning new things.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
