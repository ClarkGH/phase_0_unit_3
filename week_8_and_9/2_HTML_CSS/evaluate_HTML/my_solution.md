## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

Their CSS document doesn't go from top to bottom and then in alphabetical order. You have to search for what you want specifically. For example, the body is at the top, the page top is in the middle, and everything is out of order alphabetically.

They didn't use any h1-6 tags.

Their HTML is fine, it looks like they do a lot of repetitive actions though, they could have styled differently. It seems like the html code is created from an algorithm though.

They don't have anything in their html code for internet explorer specifically, but they may not have to. They also do not use CSS Reset.
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

they did format correctly, they closed all of their tags as we can see from lines 81 to line 87 on the HTML file. In those same lines they used a lot of the same code for tables for each of the article links. It seems to work out great.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

The authors apparently had done both in this situation. The attached css sheet is signs of the first and the code on line 32 in the html file shows it being used inside of the html file.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

There's quite a bit I don't really understand, like how they used style in the their table tag without using a style tag in itself this is on line 32 and many other lines in the html doc. That's something I learned from this activity.

In the CSS stylesheet, I have no idea what the .rotate180 does. I'll hopefully learn what it means later. 
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

The CSS was somewhat DRY, but if you look in the CSS file you'll see that the body and the td have the same styling. I think other than that it was pretty well done.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
The authors did utilize responsive design, in the .css file you see in the in the @media only line.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

My understanding is a little fuzzy. I won't lie, HTML is probably my least favorite language to work with.
